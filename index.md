## Applitools Cross Browser Hackathon

Tasked with the creation of a test automation suite in 4-6 hours, I used my Java with Selenium to automate a real world website. and compared with Applitools Visual AI automation which I integrated into a seperate suite of tests. I found that the Applitools version located much more errors which were previously not flagged as issues with the traditional approach of Selenium.
